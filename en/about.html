<h3>Dear Visitor,<br> Welcome on the Yati-Trend website!</h3>
Yati-Trend was created for people living especially here in Hungary to make them meet with<br>
the African clothes and to experience the feel of wearing such clothes.<br>
My husband, Yayra is from Ghana where wearing colourful and patterned garments are very <br>
fashionable. Nowadays, the majority of people wear dark clothes that do not really reflect <br>
their individuality.<br>
The aim with the clothes we design is to encourage people to be more opened for wearing <br>
coloured and patterned clothes which shows uniqueness and confidence. African clothes bring joy <br>
to everyday life and guarantees that its owner will always be unique as it is not a usual costume.
<br><br>

In addition to colours and patterns we also find elegance and comfort very important, so we <br>
strive to design our clothes so that everyone can enjoy it. Besides, we make sure that all <br>
garments are made of quality fabrics that are gentle to the skin and wearable in the long run.<br> 
African materials are made from 100% cotton and the fabrics we combine them with are mostly made <br>
of cotton as well.<br><br>

We hope you will find clothes in our collection that you would love to wear.<br><br>

Have a nice shopping!<br>
