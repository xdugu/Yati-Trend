		<h3>Dear Visitor,<br> Welcome on the Yati-Trend website!</h3>
		<p>Yati-Trend was created for people living especially here in Hungary to make them meet with
		the African clothes and to experience the feel of wearing such clothes.
		My husband, Yayra is from Ghana where wearing colourful and patterned garments are very 
		fashionable. Nowadays, the majority of people wear dark clothes that do not really reflect 
		their individuality.</p>
		<p>
		The aim with the clothes we design is to encourage people to be more opened for wearing
		coloured and patterned clothes which shows uniqueness and confidence. African clothes bring joy 
		to everyday life and guarantees that its owner will always be unique as it is not a usual costume.
		</p>
		<p>
		In addition to colours and patterns we also find elegance and comfort very important, so we 
		strive to design our clothes so that everyone can enjoy it. Besides, we make sure that all 
		garments are made of quality fabrics that are gentle to the skin and wearable in the long run.
		African materials are made from 100% cotton and the fabrics we combine them with are mostly made 
		of cotton as well.
		</p>
		<p>
		We hope you will find clothes in our collection that you would love to wear.<br><br>

		Have a nice shopping!<br>
		<b>Patrícia & Yayra</b>
