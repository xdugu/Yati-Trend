 <p>You may have already noticed and wondered why all our clothes have some interesting names and what they might mean. 
	Therefore, we would like to share with you three of these outfits and their names and meanings.
 </p>
 <p>
	 In West Africa, new-borns are given special names depending on the day they are born. 
	 These "day names" come in pairs for each specific day, for males and the other for females. 
	 Diverse ethnicities have variants and meanings as a symbol of cultural integrity and ancestral affiliation. 
	 In each country the spelling of the name usually indicates where the person is from and with which clan they are associated, 
	 for example in Ghana, depending on whether the parents are Ashanti, Fante, Ewe, or Ga.

 <p> <h2>Yaayaa – Born on Thursday</h2>
	It is another form of the name Yaa. People with this name have a deep inner desire for love and companionship, 
	and want to work with others to achieve peace and harmony. Because they are so affectionate and giving, they may be imposed on. 
	They are romantic and easily fall in love, but may be easily hurt and are sometimes quick-tempered.
